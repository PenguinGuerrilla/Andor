All of the values in the table are from one planetary system (v2 Lupi) containing 3 planets. The transit studied in this paper is from v2 Lupi b. Some rows have values that are absent in others. I need to use the default row and fill in the missing features from other rows.

exoplanet list: 
HD 136352 b
HD 136352 c
HD 136352 d
